# Lottery-Dapp
- A Blockchain-based decentralized Lottery app.
[Dapp - Decentralized application]
- I have deployed the application using Mumbai Polygon Faucet [ Fake Ethers ]

## Tech-Stack

## Working
- On the First Page, There are two options for a manager and a Player.
- The manager has full control over the Lottery.
- Each Player must have a Wallet and connect it to the app.
- Players must transfer one ether only to participate in the Lottery.
- As the Player will transfer ether, its address will be registered.
- A minimum of 3 Players are required for the winner to be selected.
- The manager draws the Lottery through a random Function.
- After selecting the winner, the full Balance will automatically be transferred to the Winner.
- The Contract will be reset once a round is completed.
